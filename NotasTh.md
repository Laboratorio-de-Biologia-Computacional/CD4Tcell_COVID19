Peripheral T cell lymphopenia in COVID-19: Potential mechanisms and impact
    Whilst clinical data indicate T cell lymphopenia is associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 viraemia, some studies also indicate that infection may alter the quality and phenotype of the CD4+ T cell response. Surprisingly, a higher than normal naïve-to-memory CD4+ T cell ratio has been observed suggesting an impact on the differentiation of naïve to memory T cells in COVID-19 patients 24. There was a lower frequency of regulatory T cells (T regs) in patients with severe disease compared with those with mild disease 36. Patients had reduced levels of CD4+ Th1 cells 37, with a reported Th2 skewed response in peripheral blood smears from ICU patients 38. An upregulated Th17 response was found in 39 COVID-19 patients 39. Bioinformatics analysis shows that genes involved in Th17 cell differentiation were enriched in patients with both mild and severe COVID-19 40. Altogether these observations of skewed T cell helper phenotypes suggest that the inhibition of Treg-induced anti-inflammatory responses and increased Th2 or Th17 responses, which are inflammatory without necessarily leading to viral control, could be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 41

    Similarly, in COVID-19 patients, elevation of inflammatory cytokines was also observed. In severe cases, elevations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were detected (7, 15, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29). However, a highly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response was observed, characterized by no IFN-β and low IFN-α production and activity (73). Furthermore, studies have found increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), CXCL-10/IP-10, TNF-α and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α in intensive care unit (ICU) patients compared with non-ICU patients (7). In addition, IL-6 levels were considered as a biomarker of disease severity and mortality (28, 29) and ongoing clinical trials are assessing IL-6 blockade to improve outcome in COVID-19 patients (74).
    SARS-CoV-2 prefentially infects and destroys alveolar epithelial cells that may in turn trigger the production or the overproduction by macrophages of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP1α, CCL4/MIP1β) (118).


## Cause is unclear
Peripheral T cell lymphopenia in COVID-19: Potential mechanisms and impact
    Possible mechanisms for T cell lymphopenia
    * SARS-CoV-2 infection of T cells: nope
    * T cell redistribution:  autopsy findings indicate that normal T cell circulation is interrupted during severe disease due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). Type I interferons are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and in mouse models, lymphopenia was dependent on IFN signalling 59. This may be a greater problem in the prolonged viral infection associated with severe COVID-19
    * T cell activation, exhaustion and apoptosis: Given that lymphopenia was associated with higher viral loads, dysregulation of T cell circulation could be associated with antigen-driven over-activation and exhaustion.

    3.7 Activation-induced cell death (AICD) of lymphocytes AICD leads to T cell contraction by enhancing apoptosis in previously stimulated T lymphocytes when they are re-activated via T cell receptor (TCR).113 Repeated TCR engagement renders T lymphocytes susceptible to AICD, which is mediated through the interaction of Fas expressed on stimulated T cells with FasL.113 During HIV infection, the overproduction of Th2 cell-related cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) increases the susceptibility of T lymphocytes to AICD, whereas Th1 cell-linked cytokines (such as IL-12 and IFN-γ) can be protective.

    Treatment strategies that have been considered include blocking SARS-CoV-2 from infecting T cells 43,  inhibition of cytokine secretion 73-75, mitigation of T cell exhaustion 76, 77, blockade of the chemokine receptor CCR5 78, 79, and normalization of Th1/Th2/Th17 differentiation 80, 81.

## Cytokine profile
A cytokine profile, similar to sHLH, is related to the patients with severe COVID-19, as demonstrated by enhanced TNF-α, IL-7, IL-2, granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α (Huang et al., 2020). One of the main features of ARDS is cytokine storm, that is, lethal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response, originating from the production of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-12, IL-18, IL-33 (Cameron, Bermejo-Martin, Danesh, Muller, & Kelvin, 2008; Huang et al., 2020)

Regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are negatively correlated with CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratios in patients acutely infected with SARS-CoV-2 
	Basically no good relationship between counts of Tregs
	we think that the potential effect of Tregs is unlikely mediated by secreting IL-10, because no significant correlation was found between the plasma concentrations of IL-10 and the frequencies T cell subsets
